# BITBOT

## This bot is designed to automate trading on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. It uses coded strategies to analyze market trends and make decisions on your behalf.

To get started, you will need to have an account on Binance and API keys for the bot to access your account. Once you have these, you can enter your API keys into the bot's settings and configure the bot to your desired settings, such as the currencies you want to trade and your desired profit margin.

The bot works by constantly monitoring the market and analyzing trends to identify profitable trades. When a profitable trade is identified, the bot will automatically execute the trade on your behalf. You can also set stop-loss and take-profit orders to minimize potential losses and maximize profits.

In addition to automating trades, the bot also provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to view your current trades, and other key information in real-time.

To run the bot, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. The bot can be run from the command line as it follows:

    #!/bin/bash

    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/tomycostantino/BITBOT.git

    # Change into the Trading directory
    cd BITBOT/Trading

    # Run the main.py file
    python3 main.py

Please note that further features and strategies can be included to improve the performance of the software.
